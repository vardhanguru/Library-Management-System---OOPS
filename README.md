The Library Management System is a simple application designed to manage a collection of books and allow users to borrow and return them. The system revolves around three key components: books, a library, and users.

Each book has a title, an author, and a status that indicates whether it is available or currently borrowed. Users can browse through the library's collection, borrow books they are interested in (as long as they are available), and return them when they're done.

The library acts as a central hub, storing the collection of books and keeping track of which ones are available or borrowed. It also provides the necessary functions to add books to the collection, check out books to users, and return borrowed books.

Users are individuals who interact with the library. They can browse the available books, borrow a book if it hasn’t been taken, return it once they’re done, and keep track of the books they have borrowed.

This system simulates the core operations of a real-world library but in a simple, user-friendly way. The goal is to provide users with an easy and efficient experience of borrowing and returning books, while ensuring the library accurately keeps track of its collection.
